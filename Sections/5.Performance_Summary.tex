%\textit{Performance Summary:  3-5 pages here too.  Measured and quantitative performance results.  The goal is to show how well our design meets the client requirements.  We are looking for the evidence of our successes.  This is also where we will point out any shortcomings or failings of the design.  Don’t get overly detailed with test results and technical terminology here, use this section to highlight the key points and key results of experimentation and testing.}
 
	Detail LOX Compatibility once we get data
	
%(Main Point):  The tank was determined to meet internal and external loading requirements due to the following considerations & data. 


Detail Analytical Models/FEA etc for meeting FS=2

%(Main Point): The tank is shown to hold up to an internal pressure of xxx at an operating temperature of xxx, as well as a compression loading of xx which is predicted will be experienced during launch.  These values were determined to be at a Factor of Safety = 2 for the overall design of the rocket.

Detail Scalability Analysis (ref. Jupyter Notebook)
	
%(Main Point): When scaled up from the proof of concept 3” designs, the following designs show to be feasible at a scaled up version of a 9”-11” tank.  (show numbers, analysis, etc)
